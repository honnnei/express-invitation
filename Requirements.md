TASK:
Redo the invitation task from earlier in the week. The expected behaviour is:
serve a page (not called index.html - manually create the route)
This page should have the form (styled!!) to enter the data
On submission this form should be posted to an appropriately named route.
This post route should handle(extract) the data from the form and present it in new html page
No use of jquery of showing/hiding of css here - all done 'properly' using the power of the framework!!
